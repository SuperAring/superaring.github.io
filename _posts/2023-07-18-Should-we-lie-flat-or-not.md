&emsp;In recent years, a new term has emerged in China: tang ping, which means “lying flat”. It refers to a personal choice of rejecting the high-pressure and competitive society, and opting for a simple and low-desire lifestyle. Some people see this as a passive and irresponsible attitude, while others view it as a rational and liberating decision. In this essay, I will discuss the following questions: Are we born to suffer? What is the essence of enjoyment? What are we working hard for in our lives? How can we find a balance in this time? Is lying flat wrong? Is lying flat equal to being useless? What are the benefits of lying flat?

&emsp;First of all, I do not think that we are born to suffer. Human beings have the natural right to pursue happiness and well-being, as long as they do not harm others or violate the law. Suffering is not a virtue, but a result of various factors, such as injustice, oppression, exploitation, discrimination, poverty, disease, war, etc. Therefore, we should not accept suffering as inevitable or desirable, but rather try to eliminate or reduce it as much as possible.

&emsp;Secondly, I believe that the essence of enjoyment is not materialism or consumerism, but rather inner peace and satisfaction. Many people chase after money, fame, power, status, etc., thinking that they will bring them happiness and fulfillment. However, these things are often transient, unstable, and relative. They can also cause stress, anxiety, envy, greed, corruption, etc. Therefore, we should not equate enjoyment with having more or better things, but rather with having enough and appreciating what we have.

&emsp;Thirdly, I think that we are working hard for our lives not for the sake of work itself, but for the sake of our values and goals. Work is a means to an end, not an end in itself. We work to earn a living, to support ourselves and our families, to contribute to society, to express ourselves, to learn new skills, to pursue our passions, etc. Therefore, we should not work blindly or excessively, but rather work smartly and moderately.

&emsp;Fourthly, I suggest that we can find a balance in this time by being flexible and adaptable. We live in a complex and changing world, where there are many opportunities and challenges. We cannot control everything that happens to us or around us, but we can control how we react and respond. Therefore, we should not be rigid or dogmatic, but rather be open-minded and creative.

&emsp;Fifthly, I do not think that lying flat is wrong per se. It is a personal choice that reflects one’s values and preferences. Some people may prefer lying flat because they value simplicity, freedom, relaxation, health, spirituality, etc. They may also have some valid reasons for lying flat, such as being disillusioned with the system, being exhausted by the rat race, being unable to find meaningful work, being oppressed by social norms, etc. Therefore, we should not judge or criticize them for lying flat, but rather respect and understand them.

&emsp;Sixthly, I do not think that lying flat is equal to being useless. Lying flat does not mean doing nothing or contributing nothing. It means doing less or differently. People who lie flat may still engage in some activities or pursuits that they enjoy or find valuable, such as reading, writing, gardening, volunteering, meditating, traveling, etc. They may also have some positive impacts on themselves or others, such as reducing their carbon footprint, saving resources, sharing knowledge, spreading kindness, inspiring others, etc. Therefore, we should not dismiss or underestimate them for lying flat, but rather appreciate and learn from them.

&emsp;Finally, I think that lying flat has some benefits for both individuals and society. For individuals, lying flat can help them reduce stress, improve health, enhance well-being, discover themselves, develop hobbies, etc. For society, lying flat can help it slow down, become more sustainable, diversify its culture, challenge its system, reform its policies, etc.

&emsp;In conclusion, I think that lying flat is a complex and controversial phenomenon that deserves more attention and discussion. It raises some important questions about the meaning and purpose of life, the nature and role of work, the definition and source of happiness, the balance and harmony of society, etc. I respect people’s choices to lie flat or not lie flat, as long as they are responsible and ethical. I also hope that people can find their own ways of living that suit their needs and aspirations.
