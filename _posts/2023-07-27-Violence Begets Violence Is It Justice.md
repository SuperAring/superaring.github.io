&emsp;Violence is a phenomenon that has plagued human history and society, causing pain, suffering, and death to countless individuals and groups. Violence can be defined as the use of physical force or power to harm or coerce others, or the threat of such use. Violence can take many forms, such as war, terrorism, crime, abuse, torture, and self-harm. Violence can have various motives, such as revenge, hatred, greed, fear, or ideology. Violence can have various consequences, such as injury, trauma, disability, or death. Violence can also have various impacts, such as psychological, social, economic, or political. Violence is a complex and multifaceted issue that raises many ethical and moral questions.

&emsp;One of the most controversial questions is whether violence can be justified or legitimate in certain situations or contexts. Is it ever right to use violence against those who use violence? Is it ever fair to repay violence with violence? Is it ever moral to fight fire with fire? In other words, is violence begets violence a form of justice?

&emsp;Some people may argue that violence begets violence is indeed a form of justice. They may claim that violence is the only way to deal with violence, as it can deter, punish, or eliminate the perpetrators of violence. They may assert that violence is the only language that the violent understand, as they do not respect reason or morality. They may cite the famous saying: “跟讲德之人讲理，跟无德之人讲武” (Talk reason with those who are virtuous, talk force with those who are vicious). They may give examples of historical or contemporary cases where violence was used to achieve justice, such as the American Revolution, the French Revolution, the anti-colonial struggles, the anti-apartheid movement, the civil rights movement, the feminist movement, the environmental movement, or the human rights movement. They may contend that violence begets violence is a form of self-defense, resistance, or liberation.

&emsp;However, other people may argue that violence begets violence is not a form of justice. They may claim that violence is never the solution to violence, as it can only escalate, perpetuate, or exacerbate the cycle of violence. They may assert that violence is never the answer to violence, as it can only breed more hatred, resentment, or revenge. They may cite the famous saying: “An eye for an eye makes the whole world blind” (attributed to Mahatma Gandhi). They may give examples of historical or contemporary cases where violence failed to achieve justice, such as the World Wars, the Cold War, the Vietnam War, the Iraq War, the Syrian Civil War, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the Rwandan genocide, the Darfur crisis, or the War on Terror. They may contend that violence begets violence is a form of aggression, oppression, or domination.

&emsp;What does the evidence say about these arguments? There is no definitive answer to this question, as different situations and contexts may have different outcomes and implications. However, some recent studies and books have suggested that nonviolence is more effective and sustainable than violence in achieving justice and social change . For example, researchers have found that nonviolent campaigns are more likely to succeed than violent ones in achieving political and social change , that nonviolent campaigns are more inclusive and participatory than violent ones, that nonviolent campaigns are more likely to foster democratic institutions and human rights than violent ones, and that nonviolent campaigns are more likely to reduce the risk of civil war and repression than violent ones. These findings imply that nonviolence begets nonviolence, and that nonviolence is a form of justice.

&emsp;In conclusion, violence begets violence is a contentious and complex issue that has no simple or universal answer. However, some general principles that can help us evaluate it are to be aware of the nature, motives, consequences, and impacts of violence, to seek or create alternatives to violence, to respect the dignity and rights of all human beings, and to promote peace and harmony. Violence begets violence is not a form of justice, but a form of injustice.
