&emsp;A story is a form of communication that conveys a message, a theme, or a moral to the audience. A story can be told in various ways, such as through books, movies, plays, songs, or games. A story usually consists of three main parts: the beginning, the middle, and the end. The beginning introduces the characters, the setting, and the conflict; the middle develops the plot, the suspense, and the character arcs; and the end resolves the conflict, answers the questions, and concludes the theme. But is the ending of a story more important than the other parts? How does the ending affect the overall impact and meaning of a story? What are some of the factors that make a good or bad ending? These are some of the questions that we will explore in this essay.

&emsp;The ending of a story matters because it is the final impression that the audience will have of the story. The ending shows the audience what to feel, what to learn, and what to remember from the story. The ending also reveals the purpose and intention of the storyteller. A good ending will leave the audience feeling satisfied, enlightened, and inspired. A bad ending will leave them feeling disappointed, confused, and frustrated.

&emsp;There are different types of endings that can be used in stories, depending on the genre, tone, and message of the story. Some of the common types are:

- Happy endings: These are endings where the protagonist achieves their goal, overcomes their obstacle, or defeats their enemy. The audience feels happy for them and shares their joy. Happy endings are often used in genres such as romance, comedy, or adventure.
- Sad endings: These are endings where the protagonist fails to achieve their goal, succumbs to their obstacle, or loses to their enemy. The audience feels sad for them and empathizes with their pain. Sad endings are often used in genres such as tragedy, drama, or horror.
- Ambiguous endings: These are endings where the outcome is unclear or open to interpretation. The audience is left wondering what happened or what will happen next. Ambiguous endings are often used in genres such as mystery, thriller, or science fiction.
- Twist endings: These are endings where something unexpected or surprising happens that changes the perspective or meaning of the story. The audience is shocked or amazed by the revelation or reversal. Twist endings are often used in genres such as crime, fantasy, or psychological.


&emsp;Regardless of what type of ending a story has, there are some factors that make an ending good or bad. Some of these factors are:

- Consistency: A good ending should be consistent with the rest of the story in terms of plot, character, tone, and theme. It should not contradict or ignore what has been established before. It should also not introduce new elements or information that have not been foreshadowed or explained earlier.
- Clarity: A good ending should be clear and understandable to the audience. It should not be confusing or vague to the point where the audience does not know what happened or why it happened. It should also not be too predictable or obvious to the point where the audience feels bored or cheated.
- Closure: A good ending should provide closure to the main conflict and questions of the story. It should not leave too many loose ends or unresolved issues that make the audience feel unsatisfied or frustrated. It should also not wrap up everything too neatly or conveniently that make the audience feel manipulated or unrealistic.
- Creativity: A good ending should be creative and original to the audience. It should not be clich√©d or stereotypical to the point where the audience feels disappointed or indifferent. It should also not be random or illogical to the point where the audience feels annoyed or insulted.

Summary

&emsp;The ending of a story is important because it determines how the audience will remember and evaluate the story. A good ending will enhance the impact and meaning of the story, while a bad ending will diminish them. There are different types of endings that can be used in stories, depending on the genre, tone, and message of the story. There are also different factors that make an ending good or bad, such as consistency, clarity, closure, and creativity. Knowing how to write a good ending is one of the most essential skills for a storyteller.
