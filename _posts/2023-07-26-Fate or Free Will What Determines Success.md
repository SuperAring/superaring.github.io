&emsp;Success is a highly sought-after goal in life, but what does it take to achieve it? Is it a matter of fate or free will? Do we have control over our destiny, or are we subject to the whims of chance and luck? These are some of the questions that have fascinated philosophers, scientists, and ordinary people for centuries. In this essay, we will explore different perspectives on the role of fate and free will in success, and examine the evidence from various fields and domains.

&emsp;One perspective is that success is largely determined by fate, or the predetermined course of events that is beyond human control. This view is often associated with the concept of "tian dao" (天道), or the way of heaven, in Chinese philosophy. According to this view, there is a cosmic order that governs everything in the universe, and humans must align themselves with it to achieve harmony and prosperity. Those who violate this order will face misfortune and failure. Therefore, success is not a matter of personal choice or effort, but a matter of following the natural laws and principles that are set by a higher power.

&emsp;Another perspective is that success is largely determined by free will, or the ability to act according to one's own desires and preferences. This view is often associated with the concept of "ba dao" (霸道), or the way of hegemony, in Chinese philosophy. According to this view, there is no fixed destiny or fate for anyone, and humans can shape their own future by exercising their will and power. Those who are ambitious and courageous can overcome any obstacles and challenges that they encounter, and achieve success by their own merits. Therefore, success is not a matter of external factors or luck, but a matter of personal agency and responsibility.

&emsp;A third perspective is that success is a result of both fate and free will, or a combination of predetermined and contingent factors. This view acknowledges that there are some aspects of life that are beyond human control, such as genetics, environment, culture, and historical circumstances. However, it also recognizes that there are some aspects of life that are within human control, such as education, skills, habits, attitudes, and decisions. Those who are successful are able to make use of both their given advantages and their acquired abilities, and adapt to changing situations and opportunities. Therefore, success is not a matter of either-or, but a matter of both-and.

&emsp;What does the evidence say about these perspectives? There is no definitive answer to this question, as different fields and domains may have different criteria and measures of success. However, some recent studies and books have suggested that luck plays a far greater role in success than most people realize. For example, researchers have found that about half of the differences in income across people worldwide is explained by their country of residence and by the income distribution within that country, that scientific impact is randomly distributed, that the chance of becoming a CEO is influenced by your name or month of birth, and that huge success in business is largely based on luck. These findings imply that success is not only a function of talent or skill, but also a function of opportunity or circumstance.

&emsp;Does this mean that luck is everything? Not necessarily. Luck can be seen as a part of ability, rather than an opposite or alternative to it. Ability can be defined as the capacity to perform well in a given situation or domain. However, this capacity depends not only on one's innate or acquired traits, but also on one's environment or context. For example, being born with perfect pitch may be an advantage for a musician, but not for a mathematician. Similarly, being born in a wealthy country may be an advantage for an entrepreneur, but not for an artist. Therefore, ability can be seen as a function of both fit and luck. Fit refers to how well one's traits match the demands or expectations of one's situation or domain. Luck refers to how favorable one's situation or domain is for one's traits. Those who are successful are able to find or create situations or domains that fit their traits well and offer them favorable opportunities.

&emsp;What about choice? Is it more important than effort? And is choice predetermined or free? These are difficult questions to answer, as they involve metaphysical and ethical issues that are beyond the scope of this essay. However, one possible way to approach them is to adopt a pragmatic perspective. According to this perspective, choice is not an abstract concept that exists independently of reality, but a concrete action that occurs in specific contexts. Choice is not something that we have or don't have in general, but something that we do or don't do in particular situations. Choice is not something that we can prove or disprove objectively, but something that we can evaluate or justify subjectively. Therefore, choice is not a matter of fate or free will, but a matter of pragmatism or rationality. Pragmatism refers to how well one’s choices work or succeed in one’s reality. Rationality refers to how well one’s choices are consistent or coherent with one’s values and goals. Those who are successful are able to make choices that are both pragmatic and rational, and that balance the trade-offs between effort and opportunity.

&emsp;In conclusion, success is a complex and multifaceted phenomenon that depends on various factors, such as fate, free will, luck, ability, fit, choice, effort, and opportunity. There is no simple or universal formula for success, as different situations and domains may require different strategies and skills. However, some general principles that can help us achieve success are to be aware of our strengths and weaknesses, to seek or create favorable environments and contexts, to make pragmatic and rational choices, and to adapt and learn from our experiences. Success is not a fixed or predetermined outcome, but a dynamic and evolving process.
