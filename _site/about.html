  <h3 id="该说点什么呢">该说点什么呢？</h3>
<p> Whenever I want to write something, I don’t know what to start. My notebook is blank, and sometimes I sit in front of it for hours.</p>

<p> Is it because I have too high expectations for my writing? Even when I have a topic in mind, I don’t know how to write an introduction. How can I improve this situation?</p>

<p>所以，时间的秘密是什么呢？</p>

<p>你说</p>

<p>你因为梦想</p>

<p>你说</p>

<p>你因为信仰</p>

<p>君の名は？</p>

<p>はっはあっはっははｈｈｈｈｈｈ</p>

<p>时间的意味是何呢？</p>

<h3 id="这里是看过的一节课结合别人的发言总结的">这里是看过的一节课，结合别人的发言，总结的：</h3>

<p>Don’t worry about where your passion lies, or what you really want to do. Because in this world, there are not many people who know clearly what they want to do. Of course, don’t worry how huge the project that is you want to learn, just start from the small things around you. Maybe you only have three minutes of enthusiasm, but you will also have three minutes of gain. And in the process of doing things, we will become more and more clear about what we like and what we don’t like, or what we are good at. So we will also spontaneously make some adjustments to the path ahead.</p>

<p>For ordinary people, the most inefficient way is to develop comprehensively and then be medicore in everything. Of courese, ordinary cant afford the risk, so most of them choose to develop comprehensively, which is one of the tragedies of human beings.</p>

<p>So what is the efficient way? It is to keep trying and finally find the field that we are good at and like. Then, dig out our own advantages, and then exchange with the experts in other fields, instead of insisting on ourselves, or learning everything in every field.</p>
