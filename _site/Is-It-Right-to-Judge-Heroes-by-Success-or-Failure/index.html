  <p> A hero is a person who is admired or idealized for their courage, achievements or noble qualities. Heroes are often seen as role models or inspirations for others, but they are also subject to criticism or scrutiny for their actions or outcomes.</p>

<p>​ I think that it is right to judge heroes by success or failure. success is the accomplishment of an aim or purpose, and failure as the lack of success or the omission of expected or required action. Such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Historical figures: heroes like Alexander the Great, Napoleon Bonaparte, Abraham Lincoln, etc. were praised or criticized for their achievements or failures in war, politics, social reform, etc.</li>
  <li>Sports stars: heroes like Michael Jordan, Lionel Messi, Serena Williams, etc. were admired or disparaged for their wins or losses in basketball, football, tennis, etc.</li>
  <li>Fictional characters: that heroes like Harry Potter, Batman, Katniss Everdeen, etc. were loved or hated for their triumphs or defeats in magic, crime-fighting, rebellion, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>​ success or failure is a clear and objective way to measure the worth of heroes. success or failure reflects the skills, efforts and impacts of heroes. people who judge heroes by success or failure are realistic, rational and fair.</p>

<p>​ Some one argued that it is not. they defined success as the state of being happy or satisfied with one’s life or situation, and failure as the state of being unhappy or dissatisfied with one’s life or situation. such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Humanitarians: like Mother Teresa, Nelson Mandela, Malala Yousafzai, etc. were respected or supported for their compassion, courage and vision in helping others, regardless of the results or consequences of their actions.</li>
  <li>Artists: like Vincent van Gogh, Frida Kahlo, Bob Dylan, etc. were appreciated or celebrated for their creativity, expression and originality in painting, music, etc., regardless of the popularity or profitability of their works.</li>
  <li>Ordinary people: like firefighters, nurses, teachers, etc. were honored or thanked for their dedication, service and sacrifice in saving lives, healing wounds, educating minds, etc., regardless of the recognition or reward they received.</li>
</ul>

<p>​ They said that success or failure is a subjective and relative way to measure the value of heroes. Success or failure depends on the perspective, context and expectation of heroes and others. people who judge heroes by success or failure are superficial, biased and unfair.</p>

<p>​ I think that success and failure are not only about happiness or satisfaction but also about achievement or responsibility. Things that make people happy or satisfied may not be good or right for themselves or others. heroes who were not judged by success or failure were actually cases of heroes who were successful or failed in different ways rather than heroes who were beyond success or failure.</p>

<p>​ They said that it was too narrow and impersonal. Success and failure are not only about achievement or responsibility but also about happiness or satisfaction. things that make people achieve or responsible may not be meaningful or fulfilling for themselves or others. Heroes who were judged by success or failure were actually cases of heroes who were judged by others’ or society’s standards rather than heroes who were true to themselves or their causes.</p>
