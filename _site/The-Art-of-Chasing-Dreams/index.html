  <p> How should we chase our dreams in a fast-paced world? This is a question that troubles many people. Today’s Chinese society is a very fast-paced era, where the subway is crowded with people at six or seven in the morning. High school students get up at five or six o’clock, study hard, finish their evening classes at around eleven o’clock, and then wash and sleep, with insufficient sleep time. Workers work 996, and overtime is normal. Under the fierce social competition, this also brings many negative impacts. For example, people’s physical and mental health are devastated, the decline in fertility rate has a long-term impact on society, and aging is becoming more and more serious.</p>

<p> But people always have to have dreams. In such a cruel world, how should we have dreams and pursue and achieve them? This is not a simple question, nor is there a standard answer. Everyone has their own dreams and their own ways to achieve them. However, we can explore the art of chasing dreams from the following aspects.</p>

<h3 id="define-your-dreams">Define your dreams</h3>

<p> First of all, we need to be clear about what our dreams are. Dreams are an abstract and concrete concept. They can be a lofty and difficult goal, such as becoming an astronaut or a Nobel Prize winner; or they can be a simple and practical wish, such as traveling the world or having a house that you like. No matter what kind of dream, we need to know clearly what it is, why we want it, and what it means to us.</p>

<p> Defining dreams is not easy, because we may be influenced and disturbed by external factors, such as family, society, media, etc. Sometimes we may mistake other people’s dreams for our own, or be bound by what others expect and require of us. Therefore, we need to spend time and energy to explore what we really want deep in our hearts and express it bravely.</p>

<h3 id="plan-your-dreams">Plan your dreams</h3>

<p> Secondly, we need to make a reasonable and effective plan to achieve our dreams. A plan is a bridge that turns dreams into reality. It can help us clarify what we need to do, how to do it, and when to do it. A plan can also give us more motivation and confidence to chase our dreams.</p>

<p> Making a plan is not difficult, but executing a plan is very difficult. Because in the process of chasing dreams, we may encounter various difficulties and challenges, such as time, money, resources, skills, competition, pressure, etc. These difficulties and challenges may make us feel frustrated, disappointed, exhausted or give up. Therefore, we need to have a flexible and persistent attitude to adjust our plan according to different situations and changes.</p>

<h3 id="enjoy-your-dreams">Enjoy your dreams</h3>

<p> Finally, we need to learn to enjoy the process of chasing our dreams. Dreams are a beautiful and distant goal that may require us to pay a lot of effort and sacrifice, and sometimes we may not be able to reach them. But this does not mean that we cannot get happiness and satisfaction from them. Because chasing dreams itself is an experience of growth and progress that can make us discover our potential and value, as well as make us meet new friends and partners, and gain new knowledge and skills.</p>

<p> Enjoying chasing dreams is not easy because we may be troubled by the standards and expectations set by ourselves or others, such as scores, grades, rankings, evaluations etc. These standards and expectations may make us ignore our efforts and progress, and also make us forget our original intention and fun. Therefore, we need to have a positive and grateful attitude to appreciate every step we take, and also have an open and curious attitude to explore every day.</p>

<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>

<p> Chasing dreams is an art that requires us to have clear definitions, reasonable plans, and pleasant enjoyment. How should we chase our dreams in a fast-paced world? This is a question worth thinking about and practicing. Because only when we have and chase our own dreams, can we truly live out our wonderfulness and meaning.</p>
