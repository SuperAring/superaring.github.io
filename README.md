## 该说点什么呢？
&emsp;Whenever I want to write something, I don’t know where to start. My notebook is blank, and sometimes I sit in front of it for hours.

&emsp;Is it because I have too high expectations for my writing? Even when I have a topic in mind, I don’t know how to write an introduction. How can I improve this situation?
